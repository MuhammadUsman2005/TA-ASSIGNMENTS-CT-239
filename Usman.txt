I am First year BS Computer Science student at NED University. Coding is my passion and I have learned C language from 
beginner level to advanced level. Moreover, I also do video editing and graphic designing. I am also skillful in MS Word, 
powerpoint and excel. I will enhance my coding skills to make new projects in future. InshaAllah.
